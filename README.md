# MNIST Classifier in Mina using Neural Network
## Overview 

This repository contains a neural network classifier application. It's developed as part of the ETH Global Ä°stanbul Hackathon and utilizes the MNIST dataset for training and testing purposes.  

## Installation 
### Prerequisites 
 - Nodejs: Ensure you have Nodejs installed on your system.  
 
### Running the Application 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 
2. Navigate to the cloned directory. 
3. Run the following command to start the application:

``` 
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage  
-  **Training and Transpiling:** Use the `nn_to_mina_mnist_classifier.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to train the neural network and transpile it.
-  **Data Set:** The application uses the MNIST dataset for training the neural network classifier.
